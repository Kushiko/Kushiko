# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ilya Kushmanov.

Backend Developer specializing in the PHP/Laravel ecosystem. My focus is on building reliable, scalable web applications and designing professional RESTful APIs. I have a strong background in database optimization with PostgreSQL and experience in setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.

My frontend development skills, particularly with React and TypeScript, allow me to contribute effectively to fullstack projects and understand the full product lifecycle.
